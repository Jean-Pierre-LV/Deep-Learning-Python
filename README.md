# deep_python
Toolbox worked in Python based on deep learning course of Coursera

On this repository, you will find all functions that you need to train a deep neural network, that you previously need a study to familiarize with this algorithm.  
These functions were coding in Python for users of this environment.  
The names of these functions explicitly represent the task for which it was programmed.
